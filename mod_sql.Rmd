```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sds192)
library(RMySQL)
db <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), 
  host = "scidb.smith.edu", 
  user = "sds192", 
  password = "DSismfc@S", 
  dbname = "airlines"
)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE, 
  connection = db, 
  max.print = 20
)
```

## How to get basic information about what is in tables

```{sql, connection = db}
SELECT * FROM airports;
```


```{sql, connection = db}
SHOW TABLES;
```

```{sql, connection = db}
DESCRIBE airports;
```

```{sql, connection = db}
SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 0, 20;
```

## Yelp dataset

```{r}
db <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), 
  host = "scidb.smith.edu", 
  user = "sds192", 
  password = "DSismfc@S", 
  dbname = "yelp"
)
```

```{sql connection=db}
SHOW TABLES;
```

```{sql connection=db}
DESCRIBE reviews;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM reviews LIMIT 0, 20;
```
```{sql connection=db}
DESCRIBE businesses;
```

```{sql connection=db, max.print=100}
SELECT 
  name AS restaurant, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_restaurants, 
  COUNT(*) AS num_reviews, 
  AVG(r.stars) AS avg_stars
FROM reviews AS r
JOIN businesses AS b ON r.business_id = b.id
WHERE name LIKE '%taco%'
GROUP BY id
HAVING num_reviews >= 25
ORDER BY avg_stars DESC;
```
